This is MP3::Info, for getting info out of and into MP3 files.

This release has a bunch of bugfixes, for Unicode, removing MP3 tags,
and the OOP interface.  It works around a bug in iTunes for both
ID3v2.3.0 and ID3v2.4.0 tags.

It also adds a new option for get_mp3tag() to dump out all the available
ID3v2 data (including Composer, etc.) in a more readable format.

A wrapper module is included so scripts calling MPEG::MP3Info (the
old name) will still work.

Please let me know how well it does(n't) work, and any changes you'd 
like to see.   Thanks to all of the people who have sent me feedback
and ideas.
